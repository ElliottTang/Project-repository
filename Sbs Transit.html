        <h1>Sbs Transit Buses</h1>
        <p>SBS Transit is a multi-modal public transport operator in Singapore, founded in November 2001, although
            its
            roots can be traced back to Singapore Bus Service (SBS) which formed in 1973. It runs bus and rail
            transport
            services in Singapore, and is a subsidiary of multinational land transport company ComfortDelGro.</p>
        <p>Singapore Bus Service (SBS) was initially formed in 1973 with the government-sanctioned merger of three
            private bus companies, (the Amalgamated Bus Company, Associated Bus Services and United Bus Company), to
            improve service standards of public buses being the main mode of public transportation back then. It
            then
            held a monopoly of all bus services (a duopoly following TIBS’ entry into the market in 1982) and
            remains as
            <strong>Singapore’s largest bus operator.</strong>
